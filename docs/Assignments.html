<pre class="r"><code>#rename the USArrests dataset
dat &lt;- USArrests</code></pre>
<p><strong>It is useful to rename the dataset because it is easier to work with. If the data set had a longer or more complicated name, it would be difficult and time consuming to type out the dataset name every time when you want to perform a function on the data. It also lets you keep track of your work if you make different versions of it so that it is not contaminated by changes that were meant to be on one version and not the other. This will let you replicate the work if changes were made to different versions.</strong></p>

<h3>Problem 2</h3>

<p>This dataset has the state names as row names, so we just want to make them into a new variable. We also make them all lower case, because that will help us draw a map later - the map function requires the states to be lower case.</p>

</div>
<div id="problem-3" class="section level3">
<h3>Problem 3</h3>
<p>What type of variable (from the DVB chapter) is <code>Murder</code>?</p>
<p><strong>Murder is a quantitative variable from the DVB chapter since it is a count of numbers.</strong></p>
<p>What R Type of variable is it?</p>
<p><strong>Murder is a numeric variable from the R type since it is also a count of numbers and functions such as mean or median can be applied.</strong></p>
</div>
<div id="problem-4" class="section level3">
<h3>Problem 4</h3>
<p>What information is contained in this dataset, in general? What do the numbers mean?</p>
<p><strong>The dataset contains arrest numbers for 4 types of crimes within all 50 states. Each state has a corresponding arrest rate for murder, assault, and rape, as well as the percent of urban population within the state. The numbers mean the number of arrests per 100,000 people in that state.</strong></p>

<h3>Problem 5</h3>
<p>Draw a histogram of <code>Murder</code> with proper labels and title.</p>

<p><img src="Assignments_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="672" /></p>
</div>
<div id="problem-6" class="section level3">
<h3>Problem 6</h3>
<p>Please summarize <code>Murder</code> quantitatively. What are its mean and median? What is the difference between mean and median? What is a quartile, and why do you think R gives you the 1st Qu. and 3rd Qu.?</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#finding the summary statistics of the murder variable
summary(dat$Murder)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
##   0.800   4.075   7.250   7.788  11.250  17.400</code></pre>
<p><strong>The mean of the murder variable is 7.788 murders, while the median is 7.250 murders. The mean is the sum of all data values divided by the number of values, or the average of the values within the dataset. The median, however, is the middle value after all of the values are put in numerical order. When distributions are skewed or there are outliers in the data, the median is better to use than the mean because the mean changes with skew or outliers and the median is more robust. A quartile is each of three values in which the data can be distributed into even fourths. I think that R gives us the 1st quartile and 3rd quartile because they can be used to calculate the interquartile range, which tells us the interval where half of the values within the data set lie. The median is also the 2nd quartile, so the three groups are given that split the data in even fourths.</strong></p>
</div>
<div id="problem-7" class="section level3">
<h3>Problem 7</h3>
<p>Repeat the same steps you followed for <code>Murder</code>, for the variables <code>Assault</code> and <code>Rape</code>. Now plot all three histograms together. You can do this by using the command <code>par(mfrow=c(3,1))</code> and then plotting each of the three.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#make a histogram of assault
hist(dat$Assault, main = &quot;Histogram of Assault Arrests&quot;, xlab = &quot;Number of Assault Arrests&quot;, ylab = &quot;Frequency&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="Assignments_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="480" /></p>
<pre class="r"><code>#make a histogram of rape
hist(dat$Rape, main = &quot;Histogram of Rape Arrests&quot;, xlab = &quot;Number of Rape Arrests&quot;, ylab = &quot;Frequency&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="Assignments_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-2.png" width="480" /></p>
<pre class="r"><code>#plot all three histograms together
par(mfrow=c(3,1))
hist(dat$Murder, main = &quot;Histogram of Murder Arrests&quot;, xlab = &quot;Number of Murder Arrests&quot;, ylab = &quot;Frequency&quot;)
hist(dat$Assault, main = &quot;Histogram of Assault Arrests&quot;, xlab = &quot;Number of Assault Arrests&quot;, ylab = &quot;Frequency&quot;)
hist(dat$Rape, main = &quot;Histogram of Rape Arrests&quot;, xlab = &quot;Number of Rape Arrests&quot;, ylab = &quot;Frequency&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="Assignments_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-3.png" width="480" /></p>
<p>What does the command par do, in your own words (you can look this up by asking R <code>?par</code>)?</p>
<p><strong>Par can be used to set the parameters on a graph, making it easier to combine multiple graphs into one.</strong></p>
<p>What can you learn from plotting the histograms together?</p>
<p><strong>By plotting these histograms together, you can compare the arrest rates for each crime. Murders happen the least frequently and assaults happen the most frequently. You can also see that the histogram for murder is unimodal and skewed, the histogram for assaults is bimodal, and the histogram for rapes is also unimodal and skewed.</strong></p>
</div>
<div id="problem-8" class="section level3">
<h3>Problem 8</h3>
<p>In the console below (not in text), type <code>install.packages("maps")</code> and press Enter, and then type <code>install.packages("ggplot2")</code> and press Enter. This will install the packages so you can load the libraries.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#install and load in the maps and ggplot2 packages
library(&#39;maps&#39;) 
library(&#39;ggplot2&#39;) </code></pre>
<p>Run this code:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(dat, aes(map_id=state, fill=Murder)) + 
  geom_map(map=map_data(&quot;state&quot;)) + 
  expand_limits(x=map_data(&quot;state&quot;)$long, y=map_data(&quot;state&quot;)$lat)</code></pre>
<p><img src="Assignments_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="720" /> What does this code do? Explain what each line is doing.</p>
<p><strong>The first line above the map code loads the library for both packages. The first line of the map code is creating a plot of murder. The ggplot function is telling R to create a plot, the “dat” is telling R which dataset to use in the plot, and the “aes(map_id=state, fill=Murder))” is telling R to plot each state and fill it with the corresponding murder arrest rate. The geom_map function creates shapes for a reference map, and the map=map_data(“state”) function is telling R to map the data that corresponds with the state variable that we created earlier. The expand_limits function makes sure that the entire map fits within the plot of the graph and the (x=map_data(“state”)<span class="math inline">\(long, y=map_data(&quot;state&quot;)\)</span>lat) tells R which data to base the plot limits off of, which in this case is the state data.</strong></p>

<p><strong>There are 7 variables in the dataset:</strong> <strong>1. “mjage” (How old were you the first time you used marijuana or hashish?)</strong> <strong>2. “cigage” (How old were you when you first started smoking cigarettes everyday?)</strong> <strong>3. “iralcage” (How old were you when you first tried alcohol?)</strong> <strong>4. “age2” (Recoded final edited age (since respondents had multiple chances to change their age throughout the survey))</strong> <strong>5. “sexatract” (Sexual attraction)</strong> <strong>6. “speakengl” (How well do you speak English)</strong> <strong>7. “irsex” (Imputation revised gender)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mjage, cigage, and iralcage are numeric variables (or quantitative) because the respondent gave an exact number for their answers for each variable and functions like mean can be applied to find the average age the respondents tried marijuana, cigarettes, and alcohol. Age2, sexatract, speakengl, and irsex are categorical variables because the respondents’ answers were split into categories when coded. Because respondents had the opportunity to change their age throughout the interview, the age variable was calculated from the raw birth date and the final edited interview date, the age entered in the questionnaire roster (if it exists), and the pre-interview screener age because interviewees had the opportunity to change their age throughout the interview.</strong></p>
<p>What is this dataset about? Who collected the data, what kind of sample is it, and what was the purpose of generating the data? <strong>The dataset is a small sample from the National Survey of Drug Use and Health, which was conducted by the Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality (CBHSQ, formerly the Office of Applied Studies) within the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) and is conducted by RTI International, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. The survey was conducted through a computer assisted administration, and was changed from a strictly national design to a state-based sampling plan in 1999. The primary purpose of generating the data was to measure the prevalence and correlation of substance use and mental health issues in the United States, according to the NSDUH 2019 Codebook.</strong></p>

<h3>Problem 3: Age and gender</h3>
<p>What is the age distribution of the sample like? Make sure you read the codebook to know what the variable values mean.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>hist(dat$age2, main = &quot;Histogram of Recoded Final Edited Age Categories&quot;, xlab = &quot;Recoded Final Edited Age Categories&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="Assignments_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png" width="672" /> <strong>The age variable is skewed to the left, with the majority of the values in the 14-16 bin (which means that the majority of the people in the dataset are 30 to 64 years old, according to the codebook). There are fewer people who were very young when filling out the survey, with only a few in the 4-6 and 6-8 bins (meaning that the respondents in these bins were 15-17 and 18-19, respectively).</strong></p>
<p>Do you think this age distribution representative of the US population? Why or why not?</p>
<pre class="r"><code>min(dat$age2) #the youngest respondent was 15 (category 4)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 4</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>max(dat$age2) #the oldest respondent was 65 years old or older (category 17)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 17</code></pre>
<p><strong>Yes, I think that this age distribution is representative of the US population. The survey was conducted in order to evaluate drug use, and I would think that people would not try drugs before turning 15 (the youngest respondent) and very few people would continue using drugs when they are 65 years old or older (the oldest respondent). Also, according to the codebook, the participants were randomly selected to complete the survey, which fulfills one requirement of a representative sample. It makes sense that the number of respondents increased when the respondents were 19 to 23 (8 to 12 categories) as those are the ages when most people would be exposed to marijuana, drugs, and alcohol for the first time, and that the number of respondents increased again when the respondents were 24 to 64 (categories 12 to 16), as those are the ages that people would continue to use marijuana, drugs, and alcohol as adults (especially after potentially being exposed in college). I also think that it makes sense that the majority of respondents were 34 to 64 years old, because older generations are more likely to have smoked cigarettes everyday before perception and knowledge changed.</strong></p>

<p><img src="Assignments_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png" width="672" /> <strong>From this plot, I can conclude that more males answered the survey than females, as most age categories have a higher frequency of males than females (especially in categories 6 and 7). I can also conclude than more older males answered the survey than older females. As indicated in both the plot and the table of sex and age categories, the highest five categories (13, 14, 15, 16, and 17) had more male responses than females (1 more, 4 more, 4 more, 4 more, and 5 more, respectively).</strong></p>

There are a significant number of outliers, however, for the Black, Hispanic, and White categories. The NAs for age were removed, and the unknown race category was plotted first on the graph but cannot be interpreted as it is not in the codebook. From this relationship, I can conclude that on average, all races of a similar age between 25 and 37 are killed at similar rates. While there are some outliers to this, especially for the Black and Hispanic categories, all of the medians of age for each race is almost identical.</strong></p>

</ol>
<p><strong>I think that police killings may be mislabeled or underreported because police offices do not want to admit to have killing anyone or engaging in illegal or overly forceful activities. I think that there may be disparities between the police reporting shooting and witnesses observing shootings, as police offices may be less likely to do so.

<p><strong>The correlation of the reported crime rate (measured in the number of offenses reported to police per million population) and average education (measured in the mean number of years of schooling for persons of age 25 or older times 10) is 0.32, which is pretty weak. The scatterplot of these variables proves this, as it is positive but fairly spread out. One explanation for this relationship may be that states with bigger cities are populated by people with more years of education than states with rural areas, and states with bigger cities have higher reported crime rates. While these two variables specificaly are not highly correlated (since the value was 0.32), high average education and high reported crime rates are both characteristic of states with big cities.</strong></p>

<h3>Problem 5</h3>
<p>Is the relationship between reported crime and average education statistically significant? Report the estimated coefficient of the slope, the standard error, and the p-value. What does it mean for the relationship to be statistically significant?</p>
<p><strong>The relationship between reported crime rates and average education is statistically significant.

The standard error is 0.4878, which means that the number of offenses reported to the police per million population can vary by 0.4878 offenses. The p-value is 0.02688, which means that we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a relationship between reported crime rates and average education.

<h3>Problem 7</h3>
<p>Can you conclude that if individuals were to receive more education, then crime will be reported more often? Why or why not?</p>
<p><strong>You cannot conclude that if individuals were to receive more education, then crime will be reported more often. While the p-value indicates that there is some relationship between the two variables, the correlation between them is only 0.32 and the r-squared value is 0.1042. Neither of these values indicate a strong relationship between average education and reported crime rate. This statement also implies causation, that if people received more education then crime will decrease. Causation cannot be assumed, as there may be other causes or hidden variables that influence the decrease in crime rate with increased education. Similarly, this dataset is in relation to states, not individuals, so this statement could not be proven by this linear model.</strong></p>

<h3>Problem 3: Data ethics (10 points)</h3>
<p>Describe the dataset. Considering our lecture on data ethics, what concerns do you have about the dataset? Once you perform your analysis to answer the question of interest using this dataset, what concerns might you have about the results?</p>
<p><strong>Considering our lecture on data ethics, I am concerned that the dataset is biased because the police brutality variable is based off of the reported incidents of police brutality by the departments themselves. There is no way to know if departments are under reporting brutality, so the numbers in the dataset may not be correct or may not actually be reporting the ground truth of police brutality. Once I performed my analysis, I am concerned that the results may interpreted that more funding leads to less brutality (as even stated in the question of interest). This, however, implies causation, and while there is a relationship between the two variables there may be another hidden variable that is truly causing the association. It may be that having more funding leads to better service programs being provided by the police which leads to decreased police brutality, but that is something that cannot be proven with this dataset and analysis. In terms of implications, a policy maker may look at this analysis and think that increasing funding is the best solution to decreasing police brutality, which other research has proven that may not be the case. This analysis could, essentially, cause more harm if all police departments had an increase in funding but the funding was misused or put towards other things than decreasing police brutality.</strong></p>
